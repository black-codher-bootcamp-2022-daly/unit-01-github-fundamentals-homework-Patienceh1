# What I have learnt thus far:

1. I have learnt about **Git!**
2. command line 
3. vs code
4. Terminal commands such as: touch, cd, mkdir, rm, rmdir, ls
5. Git commands such as: git clone, git remote,git add, git push, git pull
6. Introduction to HTML

# What I am still confused about:

1. Homework and assignment communication. Got a bit confused with how we found out about the assignment and homework deadline. It was through slack. As the Daly cohort is just starting, this is all new so I would have benefitted from clear communication of outstanding peices of work and where they were to be submitted.
2. I am unsure if I am using the correct user on ubuntu. For everyday use, should I be using patience@DESKTOP-26OKP4F or root@DESKTOP-26OKP4F? I had been using the latter its given me no issues but dont know if I should be using that?
